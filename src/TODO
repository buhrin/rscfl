# Resourceful TODO list

This list establishes ownership of issues and work items

* Stap kernel module (C shim):
   TODO(lc525):
    - stop resetting all values on each write (move to flight-record mode in relayfs)
    - test mmap interface for relayfs
    - provide sensible values for relayfs per-cpu buffer and sub-buffer sizes,
    in accordance to sizeof(struct accounting)
    - provide more complex measurements (sync/async) for the network stack

   TODO(oc243):
    - memory management for more than one accounting struct (we'll need a whole
    vector of them
    - zero-copy to accounting-to-relayfs (why should we allocate things twice
    and then copy? - this is messy atm, especially because there is yet another
    copy in userspace)

* User space library
   TODO(jas250):
    - Init function to setup mmap and userspace api. DONE
    - mmap in relayfs file instead of continually calling open. DONE
    - Print what ever we have on program exit. DONE
    - Extend API to take name of system call to account for, pass this down
      to the kernel layer.
    - Reuse NETLINK socket from acct_next. One per user thread should suffice.
    - Call rsfcl_init automatically on library load
