If you build Resourceful with -DWITH_DOCS=ON then the documentation in html form
will be compiled using Sphynx and placed in the build directory:

$RSCFL_ROOT/build/doc/html

Access index.html in that folder using a browser to navigate the documentation

If you want to build/rebuild just the docs (after cmake has generated all the
required makefiles), you just have to run

[..build]$ make doc
