\subsection*{Abstract}


\section{Introduction}
Tying resource accounting to dependability.

Use cases:\newline
Inc. async effects.


\section{Related Work}
Existing tracing / profiling systems. (Maybe a chart outlining differences).

FTrace, SystemTap (raw) / DTrace, Perf.

Existing use of tracing for dependability.\newline
Root-cause analysis. Debugging. Performance monitoring - how do we compare to
top?


\section{System Design}
\subsection{Kernel / Tracing infrastructure}
Async / Sync tracing (multiple layers, kworkers etc).

Call granularity tracing.

Trace-point idenfitication - CScope, call site vs function.

Moving from ST to KProbes (more dynamic).

\subsection{Userland API}
Interface definition.

Discussion around automatically adding this (compiler).

\subsection{What we implemented}


\section{Evaluation}
Describe use case (lighttpd).\newline
End-to-end example of use of resourceful. Show this is useful. `We show how this
is useful.'

Overhead evaluation.\newline
Space / time overhead. Mem. consumed. Time o/h of various workloads.

Latency and throughput degradation.\newline
For instrumented lighttpd. For something else running at the same time.
